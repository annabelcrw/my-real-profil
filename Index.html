	  <H2>Travelling</H2>
	  <p>
		I am passionate about travelling all around the world. I've been to the United States of America several times, visited Europe and my next trip will be Asia. This year, I went on a road trip by myself from Toronto to Miami. It was the best decision I've ever made. I am so grateful for this opportunity !

	  <H2>Music</H2>
	  <p>
		I also am found of music. I've played the piano for 8 years and I sing. I've been singing my whole life and it helps me not to be stressed, be happier and I'm in a much better mood when I sing ! It might be annoying for others (sorry not sorry though). Music is such an important part of my life.
